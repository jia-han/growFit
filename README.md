## Proposed Level of Achievement:

Project Gemini

## Motivation:

We want to be more motivated to exercise, so we decided to think of something which can appeal to more people and especially students. We felt that current exercise applications are too unvaried and boring. Hence, we want to make something more exciting by gamifying exercise.

## Aim:

To encourage a healthier lifestyle by the means of a reward system of a game.

## User Stories:

1. As a student who is busy with schoolwork and lacks motivation to exercise, I want to be more motivated to exercise than with the current fitness apps.

2.  As a student who tends towards games to destress, I want a fitness app that allows me to exercise and earn rewards at the same time.

3.  As a student who seldom exercises, I want a fitness app that has a daily goal to encourage myself to exercise more frequently.

4.  As a student who is lazy to exercise, I want a fitness app that is engaging enough to make me want to exercise.

## Scope of Project:

The cross-platform mobile app suitable for IOS and Android provides a gamified approach to current fitness apps, with users taking care of their pet through completing daily exercise goals.

### Features and Timeline:

To finish by mid June:

-   User starts off with a virtual pet they take care of
    
-   Daily challenges: do x amount of steps in a day, do x minutes of exercise to earn coins and XP
    
-   Treat system: the pet will ‘grow’ after a certain amount of treats fed
    
-   Coin shop: to buy decorations/treats
    

To finish by mid July:

-   Gallery: to save screenshots
    
-   Share with friends function: share screenshots of progress

## Tech Stack:

1.  Flutter (Frontend)
    
2.  Firebase (Backend)
    
3.  Google Fit API

## How are we different from similar platforms?
**Strava**

-   The application has the same boring interface as other fitness applications, with the exception of its focus towards social workouts, thus it is not engaging enough for users who do not have the motivation to exercise in the first place.

**Nike Training Club**
    

-   The application is catered more towards users who were already motivated to exercise and want workout plans to help them be more focused, thus it is not suited for beginners who desire the motivation to start exercising in the first place.
