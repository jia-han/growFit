UI designed with Flutter, with Firebase for authentication.


## How to use:

Important stuff to have:
1. Android Studio with emulator (https://developer.android.com/studio)
3. Flutter (https://flutter.dev/) and its dependencies
4. FlutterFire (https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) For Firebase CLI: If the binary doesn't work, use the npm version instead!
