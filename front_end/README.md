UI designed with Flutter, with Firebase for authentication.

## IMPORTANT

This is a test environment and will be extremely buggy please bear with it thanks :(


## How to use:

Important stuff to have:
1. Android Studio with emulator (https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Flutter (https://flutter.dev/)
3. FlutterFire (https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) For Firebase CLI: If the binary doesn't work, use the npm version instead!
